                    <p class="blog-desp" style="color: black;">
                        The term "Internet" refers to a global computer network made up of interconnected networks that use standardized communication protocols to provide a variety of information and communication services.
                         Since the internet's beginnings in 1969, our lives have changed dramatically, especially since the late 1990s. 
                         The majority of the changes have been positive, but the internet has also had negative consequences. 
                         Our lives will be eternally transformed as a result of the internet's inception, as it has made life easier for us. "Or the positive affects, they are that the technology we are able to change the way we live in the twenty-first century.
                         For example, consider the advent of Messenger, which allows individuals to communicate through live video broadcasts. Providing us with a more convenient means of communication as well as a more convenient means of obtaining and sharing information, such as through the use of Wikipedia.
                         However, the internet has negative consequences, such as distracting us from daily activities and causing us to lose our sense of reality, such as taking photos while eating or even texting while eating, which causes us to lose our communication skills.<br><br>
                         Not only has the internet turned our world on its head, but it has also revolutionized the way we communicate.<span id="dots">..</span
                            ><span id="hiddenText">
                         We now live in global villages where we all speak the same language. The US military was the first to use the internet for communication.
                         From a communication standpoint, the internet has ushered in new developments and techniques for keeping in touch, not only for individuals but also for businesses. 
                         An example of how the internet has impacted communication is how doctors are now communicating with their patients or other doctors via live video feeds via the internet to diagnose the patients or even to help guide and advise surgeons through  complicated procedures.<br><br>
                         People are interacting with each other more and more these days through various platforms such as apps, role playing online games, social media, and so on. 
                         Many children's physical interaction skills have been harmed as a result of this advancement. As a result, they have no idea how to interact with others when they meet them in person or what gestures to make.
                         We are also abandoning face-to-face interaction, which can strengthen bonds and relationships with family and others. which has now become a major issue that has impacted our daily lives.
                         <br><br> We can see from the beginning of the 21st century that the Internet has greatly influenced us. 
                         The Internet provides us with new ways of communicating, working and sharing information. Clearly, the Internet will and has changed the way people live in the future, and it will have a greater impact on almost every aspect of our daily life, society and even the whole world.
